# First assignment

## Short description

The goal of this assignment is to create an ALU and Flip Flop component and then connect the ALU with 3 Flip Flops. This assignment had to be completed only using structural vhdl code. All components of needed to construct the ALU an the Flip Flop such as th ALU operations and the laches also have been constructed using structural code.

## Components
	
* ALU: Takes 2 16-bit numbers and a 3-bit control signal as inputs and returns the result of the selected opperation. It can exicute the add, or, sub, and, greater or equal and not opperations
* Flip Flop: A 16-bit possitive trigered Flip Flop. 

## Final product

An ALU that uses the data stored in 2 Flip Flops as inputs and stors its output in another Flip Flop.
