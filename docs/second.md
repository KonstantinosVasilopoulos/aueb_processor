# Second assignment

## Short description

In this assignment some more components needed for the CPU where created.

## Components
	
* **Register**: Stores data using Flip Flops.
* **Register 0**: A register that has 0 permanently stored.
* **8 to 1 multiplexer**: Returns one of its 16 inputs based on a 3 bit control signal.
* **3 to 8 decoder**: Decodes a 3-bit signal to 8 output signals.
* **Register File**: A file consisting of 8 registers one of witch is a Register 0. 
* **Sign extender**: Extents the immediate filed.
* **Jump Address calculator**: Calculates the new address when using the jump command.
* **ALU control**: Decides what operation the ALU must
